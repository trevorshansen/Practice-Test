# Practice-Test

Reads from text file filled with practice questions for a test, 
breaks them up into test sizes of your choosing and gives them to you one at a time.

Repeats until user quits, also allows the user to recalibrate the settings 
such as number of tests and reshuffles questions.

List.h is a linked list data structure that I wrote for my data structures class. 
It would prbably be better to use something like a vector for this, 
but since the amount of questions should be somewhat small it probably won't matter.
